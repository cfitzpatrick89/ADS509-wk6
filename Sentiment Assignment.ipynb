    "\n",
    "A: For Cher, \"Perfection\", \"My Love\", and \"Love and Understanding\" have the highest sentiment score. The lowest sentiment songs are \"Dressed to Kill\", \"Outrageous\", and \"I walk on guilded splinters\".  As we can see in the lyrics, the positive songs are very much about love and relationships and general romance. The negative sentiment songs are a bit more jaded, and have more negative imagery with smoke and depressing themes etc.\n",

    "Q: For your second artist, what are the three songs that have the highest and lowest sentiments? Print the lyrics of those songs to the screen. What do you think is driving the sentiment score? \n",
    "\n",
    "A: For Robyn, we see some similar themes. The three highest sentiment songs are \"Love is Free\", \"Show me Love\", and \"u should know better\". The first two are a bit obvious, very love-centric. The last song is a bit of a mystery, as looking at the lyrics and it doesn't seem amazingly positive, kind of her teller a lover they could and should have done better. \n",
    "\n",
    "The negative songs are \"Criminal Intent\", \"Dont Fucking Tell Me What to Do\", and for somereason, the same song again but 114520. I am not sure what happened with that one. But regardless, these negative songs are quite obviously negative, with words like killing very prevalant, and rebellious attitudes present. \n",
